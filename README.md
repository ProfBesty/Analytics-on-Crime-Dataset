In our world today, crime is a big problem, and it's getting worse. This makes it hard for police officers everywhere to do their job. To make things better, they need to use new technologies and look at data more closely. This story talks about how looking at crime data can help police do a better job in a big city.

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

The big-city police department I work with is facing more and more crime, and they want to find better ways to stop it before it happens. They asked our company, Datafied Technologies, for help using data analysis to learn about crime patterns, where crime might happen a lot, and how to stop it from happening. As a junior data analyst at Datafied Technologies, my job is to:

Figure out crime patterns and trends using data.
Find out where crime might happen a lot using data.
Make the plans for stopping crime better using what we learn from the data.

<h1>Data Sourcing</h1>

The data we have comes from the police and covers crime from March 2013 to 2023. It's considered very reliable and follows strict rules set by the Home Office. This makes sure the information is fair and meets professional standards for statistics.
