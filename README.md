<h1>Business problem</h1>

Mary is the owner of a small pharmacy located in a busy city center. She has been running the pharmacy for the past few years and has noticed that sales have stagnated. Despite the competitive pricing, Mary's Pharmacy has struggled to attract new customers.

To try and improve her business, Mary decided to contact Datafied Technologies to conduct a thorough analysis of her sales data using the transactional data collected over the past 6 years. She exports the data from her Point-of-Sale system, which includes information on the date and time of each sale, the name of the pharmaceutical drug sold, and the quantity of each drug sold.

You are the senior data analyst at Datafied Technologies. You are required to come up with business questions and generate metrics that could be tracked to identify trends and patterns in the sale of pharmaceutical drugs sold in the pharmacy over time. You also need to visualize the data and create dashboards to uncover hidden insights and track the metrics you have defined for the business.

Mary needs your help to uncover valuable insights about her business and take action to improve its performance. Mary intends to use this newfound knowledge to make informed decisions about her inventory and marketing strategies, ultimately leading to an increase in sales and the growth of her business.
